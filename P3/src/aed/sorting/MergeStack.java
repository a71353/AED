//Class that implements a stack of runs, specially designed for the SmartMergeSort algorithm.
//This implementation of a stack is special, because we want to push, but we need to access
//elements other than the top of the stack, and we also need to do collapses.
//A collapse is when you collapse two consecutive runs on the stack, merging them into a single run in the stack.
//This class should be declared as default, since this is an auxiliary class to be used in the SmartMergetSort algorithm.
//However, in order to make Mooshak tests easier, this is made public.
