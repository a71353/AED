//This class represents a Run in an array, i.e. a sequence or a part of the array where all elements are ordered
//A Run is represented by a starting position (representing the index where the Run begins), and a length.
//The length represents how many elements of the array, starting from the index start, are ordered

//This class should be declared as default, since this is an auxiliary class to be used in the SmartMergetSort algorithm
//However, in order to make Mooshak tests easier, this is made public.
